            This is a description/summary/synopsis box. So basically you can put
            any text in here and this will consist of the chunk of this
            component....... Damn it feels so nice to just be able to design a
            website but I’ve got to say that this definitely takes a lot of work
            and damn I will fall behind in terms of school and everything but
            this is probably one of the most rewarding things that I will be
            able to do so I don’t really regret taking the time and just
            designing this website. This is probably the hardest part of the
            entire thing and also the most taxing, because let’s face it I’m
            more interested in the actual programming aspect of this entire
            thing. Now, on to some actual content can we just appreciate how
            this haikyu picture looks because honestly with that box shadow and
            everything it looks insanely good. This is making me excited for
            when I actually start making these components for real use.
